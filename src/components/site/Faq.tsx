const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "Do I need to be good with computers?",
    a: "No. If you can use WhatsApp and M-Pesa, you can use Suppli Afya. It runs on your phone, and the part your customers see is just as simple.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this from BF Suma?",
    a: "No. Suppli Afya is an independent tool built for people who sell BF Suma products. It doesn't change how you buy stock, your upline, or your account with the company.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who owns my customer list?",
    a: "You do. Your customers and their records belong to you. We don't sell your data, share it with other distributors or contact your customers ourselves, and if you leave, you can take your list with you.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does my customer need?",
    a: "A phone with a browser and WhatsApp. There's no app to download and no account to create.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if a customer's answers point to a medical problem?",
    a: "The health check looks for things that should be checked by a doctor, like pregnancy, certain medicines, or symptoms that need attention, and tells the customer plainly. You see the same notes on your side, so you can advise them properly.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does M-Pesa work with it?",
    a: "Every order shows whether it's been paid. When a customer sends money, record it against their order in a couple of taps, with the M-Pesa code, and anything still owed shows up on your list until it's in. Sending M-Pesa requests straight to a customer's phone is coming to the Pro plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost?",
    a: "Starter is KES 1,500, Growth is KES 2,900 and Pro is KES 4,900 a month. You pay each month by M-Pesa or card. Nothing is taken automatically, so there's nothing to cancel: if you stop renewing, your plan simply ends.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if my payment doesn't go through?",
    a: "Your account is kept. You can try again straight away, with M-Pesa or a card, without filling anything in twice.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I try it before paying?",
    a: "The health check on this page is the real one your customers will use, so you can see exactly what they get. The portal opens once you've chosen a plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use it for other brands?",
    a: "Not yet. The health check and product information are built around BF Suma's range, because that's who it's for.",
  },
